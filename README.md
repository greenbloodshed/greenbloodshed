## Welcome! 👋

I go by greenbloodshed in the tech/hacker space. Bonus points to those who can figure out what my name is referencing. 💬 Here's a hint, it is paying homage to a certain fictional people.

👯 I created a Github to follow certain developer's work, explore more open source software, and learn.

⚡ I am an IT professional, aspiring security engineer and cybersecurity enthusiast. I'm also a life long gamer, and a Trekie.

🌱 I am currently learning Python. Check out my 'python-learning' repo to see my progress, or learn along!
